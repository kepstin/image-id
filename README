This is a tool to compute the MusicBrainz disc id from a CD image.

Requirements:
libdiscid, from http://musicbrainz.org/doc/libdiscid
libmirage >= 2.1.0, from http://cdemu.sourceforge.net/project/

Known working versions of libmirage are 2.1.x and 3.0.x

Keep in mind that libmirage tends to break API between versions. If image_id
doesn't work with the latest please either try an older libmirage, open a
ticket on github, or send me a pull request with the required updates.

This package is built using autotools; the standard invocation:

./configure && make
(optionally) sudo make install

should give you a working build.

If you are building from git, run
./autogen.sh
to generate the configure script.
