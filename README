This is a tool to compute the MusicBrainz disc id from a CD image.

Requirements:
libdiscid, from http://musicbrainz.org/doc/libdiscid
libmirage >= 2.0.0, from http://cdemu.sourceforge.net/pkg_libmirage.php

Keep in mind that libmirage tends to break API between versions. If image_id
doesn't work with the latest please either try an older libmirage, open a
ticket on github, or send me a pull request with the required updates.
